      | This was the second project built with react boilerplate. I used  
      a(href='https://www.postgresql.org/')  PostgreSQL 
      | and 
      a(href='https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise') pg-promise 
      | for data storage to familiarize myself with using SQL and relational databases with full 
      | stack react applications. 
    p
      | In this project I was more conscious of reusing components. For example, the Button component 
      | leverages styled components to provide different styles of the button based on the props passed to it.
    p
      | The project made me even more comfortable with the tools and libraries used by react boilerplate as well 
      | as made me consider the differences between relational and document based databases.
