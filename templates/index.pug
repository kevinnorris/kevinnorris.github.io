    p Hi Iâ€™m Kevin!
    p
      | I built this portfolio to show my journey into web development. The projects are organized in 
      | chronological order, starting from the most recently completed. 
    p
      | A year ago I had never touched web development, sticking mostly to Java during my studies, with 
      | some python thrown in for scripting tasks and the occasional C# project. 
    p
      | After completing my MSc in Computer Science,  I took some time off to go travelling and to try new things.
    p
      | I opened and ran an artisan baked good market stall for half a year. The experience was enjoyable and 
      | allowed me to improve my communication, marketing, and business know-how.
    p
      | After that, I tried my hand at internet marketing. As part of my internet marketing  experience, I made 
      | simple websites and found that I really enjoyed this portion of the job. During this time, I found Free 
      | Code Camp and started dabbling in their curriculum. I was drawn to the project-based learning and the 
      | chance to help nonprofits. As I found myself spending more and more time learning web development and less 
      | time focusing on internet marketing I decided in October of 2016 to follow my passion and dedicate full 
      | time to learning web development.
    p
      | In between these, I also travelled around the United States, Europe, and New Zealand as well as spent 
      | my time enjoying my hobbies including woodworking and hiking.
